Function to parse strings.

In math functions with singularities in the derivative, check that the mean is
not close to the singularity and warn the user on cerr.

Second order propagation.

Improve default numerical derivative algorithm.

Overload `std::numeric_limits`.

UReal::isindep should return true if `id < 0` but `sigma.size() <= 1`.

Check if `UReal` works as user type to Eigen.
