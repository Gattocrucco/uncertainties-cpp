Function to parse strings.

In math functions with singularities in the derivative, check that the mean is
not close to the singularity and warn the user on cerr.

Second order propagation.

Improve default numerical derivative algorithm.

Overload `std::numeric_limits`.

UReal::isindep should return true if `id < 0` but `sigma.size() <= 1`.

Check if `UReal` works as user type to Eigen.

* center moments using m(1).
* understand how to center generic correlations
* solve bug in ConstTriIt iterating over the diagonal
* understand the multeplicity of multiindex terms: have I already included the multeplicity needed by sorted iteration in the generation?
